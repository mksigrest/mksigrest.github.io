                Documentation Created and Updated

                Game design is easy to understand and use, with win and loss screen, no code bugs, and great fun</p>
            <p>Design Process:
                I wanted my game to be fun, easy to understand and use, and not hard to complete. I based my code off the 
                DOM adventure code, and continued from there. With the base code, I updated and created my own functions, 
                well surpassing the 50% original code expectation. I wanted to include 2 different enemy types, a health system 
                that could lead to a game over, attacking system that allowed you to clear out monsters, and door sytem where 
                you had to gather keys to unlock certain areas to progress. I worked on each of these parts one step at a 
                time, updating old code where needed and creating my own for functions like attacking and passing doors.</p>
            <p>Outside sources:
                Chat GPT was used for helping me fix syntax errors when needed
                Pixil Art was used to create new graphics for the doors and keys</p>
