            <p><b>Role:</b> Project Manager and Developer</p><p><b>Languagues Used:</b> HTML, Javascript, CSS</p><p><b>Programs Used:</b> Visual Studio Code, Github, Pixil Art</p>
            <p>
              <b>What is the purpose of this application:</b>
              This is meant to be a simple top-down adventure tile based game. It is not meant to be super hard or
              extremely complicated. I designed it for ease of use of the consumer. The game is supposed to be a both a puzzle
              solver of finding the best route, and also a 2D parkour type of dodging enemies.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>What was the design process:</b>
              I wanted design that was very easy to complete and not hard to understand. I wanted to include 2 different 
              enemy types, a health system that could lead to a game over, attacking system that allowed you to clear out 
              monsters, and door sytem where you had to gather keys to unlock certain areas to progress. I worked on each of 
              these parts one step at a time, creating functions, variables, and assets to do so.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>What did I learn in this design process:</b>
              I learned how to move characters through javascript programming in a tile based map. I programmed true/false gates 
              for the special colored doors. I learned how to create pixil assets, and how to import and impliment them into my 
              game for use.
