              <b>What is the purpose of this application:</b>
              This application is my own API, meant to be able to find countries based off of capitals, location, and financial
              information. It allows you to add countries to the API list locally, and search for them once added. You are able
              to search with HEAD or GET, returning heading or full information respectively. You can also edit a countries capital
              with the final node.

              <b>What was the design process:</b>
              I started my design based around retrieving and parsing the information from Dog CEO. I parse the initial request 
              made by the user for the dog breed and amount of photos, and then I return the images found to the results tab, 
              and the first photo goes to the main focus. I designed the next and previous to move through the parsed photos only
              appearing on the site.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>What did I learn in this design process:</b>
              I learned how to XHR response urls, for the purpose of putting the dog photos on the screen. I continued
              to learn more about Javascript, HTML, and CSS coding, as well as formatting webpage designs.
