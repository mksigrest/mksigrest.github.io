              <b>What is the purpose of this application:</b>
              This game is supposed to be a simple top down asteriod blaster where you control a space ship.
              You are meant to move the space ship around in 2D space, and right click to shoot the asteroids.
              You will move onto the next level when you fully clear out all the asteroids in that one. The game
              will get progressively harder as you go on.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>What was the design process:</b>
              I wanted my game to be endless, yet still get progressively more difficult. I designed with that in mind,
              creating classes for my ship, asteroids, and bullets. I implimented a randomized trigionemetry for each asteroid
              instance so that they could move anywhere on the 2D place at the start. I also implimented this games HTML through
              Javascript, since I needed the ability to instantiate html pieces in different places through the start, gameplay,
              and end screens.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>What did I learn in this design process:</b>
              I learned about JS classes, implimenting trigionemetry and randomization into a JS class object. I continued
              my learning development with javascript itself, asset loading, and sound design in gaming. I also learned how
              to deploy this game through RIT's banjo server.
