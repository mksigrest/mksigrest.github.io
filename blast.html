            <p><b>Role:</b> Programmer</p><p><b>Languagues Used:</b> C#</p><p><b>Programs Used:</b> Visual Studio, Github</p>
            <p>
              <b>What is the purpose of this application:</b>
              This application is meant to simulate how an ordering kiosk for a RIT dining resturant could possibly work.
              There is a login/signup ability, which will keep your information throughout login and logout. You can add items
              to your order, where the prices will add up in the checkout screen.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>What was the design process:</b>
              This was a group project, and it allowed us to get comfortable using github as a collaboration tool rather than
              an individual storage space. I was in charge of designing the add to order pages, along with the item classes that
              would be added to each order. I designed a main food class, and a child class for drinks.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>What did I learn in this design process:</b>
              I learned about merge conflicts in github, how to resolve them, and how to successfully parse coding work among a group
              of people so that the project is sucessfully finished. I continued gaining knowledge in C# programming, with my job
              allowing me to do more reaserch into C# classes and child classes, learning more about inheritance.
